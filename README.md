## Overview

CVE-2024-50623 is a critical vulnerability identified in Cleo's file transfer software products—Cleo Harmony, Cleo VLTrader, and Cleo LexiCom—versions prior to 5.8.0.21. This flaw allows for unrestricted file uploads and downloads, potentially leading to remote code execution.

# Affected Devices

- Cleo Harmony (prior to version 5.8.0.21)
- Cleo VLTrader (prior to version 5.8.0.21)
- Cleo LexiCom (prior to version 5.8.0.21)

# Affected Components

The Cleo software automatically processes files from specific directories like autorun without proper validation or sandboxing. This creates a security risk because attackers can write arbitrary files to these directories, which are then executed by the software.
